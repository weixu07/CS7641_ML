1. In this project, I have used two datasets which are saved in the project folder and into 

..\Case I\data\loan_data.CSV
..\Case II\data\winequality-white.CSV

2. The programming is used by Python. Each algorithm as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Boosting, Support Vector Machines, and k-Nearest Neighbors is implemented in an independent .py file  

3. The python files and datasets can be downloaded using the following git command:
git clone https://github.com/weixu07/CS7641_ML.git

4. To run any algorithm on any dataset, please go to corresponding folder such as Case I or Case II. 

5. Run corresponding python file named as algorithm name. Such as 
python SVM.py

Libray: sklearn

Decision Trees: DecisionTreeClassifier
